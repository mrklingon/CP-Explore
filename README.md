# Galaxy Explorer

Here's a project that combines ideas from my [one-dimensional arcade game](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/mrklingon/pages/is-that-a-good-idea-building-a-one-dimensional-starfighter-game) and [orrery project](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/mrklingon/pages/is-that-a-good-idea-building-a-one-dimensional-starfighter-game). Think "1930's pulp science fiction" and you'll get the idea: The Circuit Playground lets you navigate a galaxy defined in a 100 element array with around 60 stars. You can stop at any one of the solar systems and observe an orrery-like display of the movement of the planets.

For me, the fun here  is creating a UI with the CPX controls:
